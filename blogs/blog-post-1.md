## SOME RULES
1. One Idea per mini essay
2. Keep them short (100- 700 word / 10-30mins)
3. Stay Organized (folders, tags, refs)
4. Link Related Mini essays 

<br>

## The Three Part Structure
Intro > Body > Conclusion
its like the default format
stuck or direction? take it and morph it a bit
pretty nice format

<br>

### Intro / Hook
this is where a pull your audience's attention
1. Make the premise clear. declare, make the main idea clear
2. spark curiosity. clarity + curiosity

<br>

<b>EXAMPLES: </b>
- Make a bold/ strong statement (interesting / controversial)
- Inspire emotion. make it dramuh-tic
- ask question: both clarity + curiosity (I can see myself using it the most)
- tell a story 

<br>

## Body / main
just talk about it and express it clearly. If you ever find yourself struggling to continue writing. Look away from the screen and get into omniscient reader's viewpoint. Read it from that pov and you will be able to detect flaws and other rooms for improvement

<br>

## Conclusion
take all the details and condense them into a final message. a neat summary. just pin the big idea down

<br>

## STORY NOTES
stories are the vehicles of your message. basically analogies
